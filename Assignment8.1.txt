1. What is the total amount of petrol in volume sold by every distributor?

a=load ‘/home/acadgild/Desktop/petrol-dataset.txt’ USING PigStorage(‘,’) AS (ID:chararray, name:chararray, buy:chararray, sell:chararray, in:int ,year:int);
b=group a by name;
c= foreach b GENERATE group,SUM(a.out)

2. Which are the top 10 distributors ID's for selling petrol? Also display the amount of petrol
sold in volume.

a=load ‘/home/acadgild/Desktop/petrol-dataset.txt’ USING PigStorage(‘,’) AS (ID:chararray, name:chararray, buy:chararray, sell:chararray, in:int ,year:int);
b=group a by ID;
c= foreach b GENERATE group,SUM(a.out) as sum;
d= order c by sum DESC;
e=limit d 10;

3. List 10 years where consumption of petrol is more with the distributer id who sold it.

a=load ‘/home/acadgild/Desktop/petrol-dataset.txt’ USING PigStorage(‘,’) AS (ID:chararray, name:chararray, buy:chararray, sell:chararray, in:int ,year:int);
b=group a (ID, year);
c= foreach b GENERATE a.ID as id, a.year as year, SUM(a.in) as cons;
d= order  c by cons DESC;
e=foreach d GENERATE id,year;
e=foreach d GENERATE flatten(id), flatten(year);
f= limit e 10;

4. Find the distributer name who sold petrol in least amount. 

a=load ‘/home/acadgild/Desktop/petrol-dataset.txt’ USING PigStorage(‘,’) AS (ID:chararray, name:chararray, buy:chararray, sell:chararray, in:int ,year:int);
b=group a by year;
c= foreach b {
temp = foreach a GENERATE in-out;
generate a.name as name, a.year as year, sum(temp) as sale;};
d=order c by sale DESC;
e=foreach c generate flatten(name);
f=limit e 1;
